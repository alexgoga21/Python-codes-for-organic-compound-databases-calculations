This script calculates the size-normalized Spacial Score (nSPS) for molecules 
based on their SMILES representations. It can also update an existing dataset 
by detecting empty values in the 'Spacial Score' column and computing results 
only for those entries, leaving previously calculated values unchanged.

Further details about its functionality are fully explained inside the script itself.
