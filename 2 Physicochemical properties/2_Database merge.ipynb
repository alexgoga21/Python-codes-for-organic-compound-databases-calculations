    "Code function:\n",
    "1) This code merges a compound database (with previously determined physicochemical properties and chirality using the code:\n",
    "   'Physicochemical properties and chirality.ipynb') with another set of new compounds whose descriptors were calculated separately \n",
    "   with the same code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements/Notes:\n",
    "1) Both databases are merged based on their 'ID'. Therefore, both databases MUST have:\n",
    "    - A column with the header 'ID'\n",
    "    - Matching IDs for the compounds to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Original database (example format, first 5 rows):\n",
    "        ID      Smiles        SlogP\n",
    "        001     CCO           0.77\n",
    "        002     C1CCO1        0.85\n",
    "        003     CCN(CC)C      2.54\n",
    "        004     COC           <empty>\n",
    "        005     CC(=O)O       <empty>\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Contains compounds with properties already calculated (IDs 001–003).\n",
    "        - Also contains new compounds (IDs 004–005) with missing properties.\n",
    "        - Keeps other metadata fields (not shown in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "    New compounds (results file example format, corresponding to missing ones):\n",
    "        ID      Smiles        SlogP\n",
    "        004     COC           1.12\n",
    "        005     CC(=O)O       -0.34\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Only the calculated descriptors and chirality information of the new compounds.\n",
    "        - Does not need extra metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1) Before applying this code, both databases should have their descriptors calculated with \n",
    "         'Physicochemical properties and chirality.ipynb'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The descriptors of the 'new compounds' MUST be calculated with \n",
    "   'Physicochemical properties and chirality.ipynb' in a separate file from the 'original database'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Once both databases have the physicochemical properties calculated with the code mentioned above,\n",
    "   use this script to merge them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The file database merged.xlsx contains the calculated descriptors and chirality information of all the new compounds.\n",
