'1_Physicochemical properties and chirality.ipynb'

Code function:
1)This code calculates the following descriptors SlogP, TPSA,   MW, NumRotatableBonds,  NumHBD and  NumHBA.
2)Also calculates some parameters related with the chirality: NumStereocenters and  NumUnspecifiedStereocenters.
    2.1)The compounds are classified according to their chirality: chirality annotated, chirality not annotated and achiral.
    
 '2_Database merge.ipynb'
 
 Code function:
 1)This code is to merge a compound database which previously was determined their physicochemical properties and chirality with the code:
 '1_Physicochemical properties and chirality.ipynb' with another set of new compounds whose these same descriptors were calculated with the above   
 mentioned code, but, in a separate file.
 
All the additional details and requirements of both codes are inside the .ipynb files.
