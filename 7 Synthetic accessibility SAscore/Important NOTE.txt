Important NOTE:

This script calculates the Synthetic Accessibility Score (SA_Score) for molecules
from an input Excel file containing at least the columns 'ID' and 'Smiles'.

The SA_Score index is reported in: https://doi.org/10.1186/1758-2946-1-8

It can be used to update an existing database that already has SA_Score values.
The script automatically calculates SA_Score only for the missing entries, leaving
previously computed values unchanged.

Progress is shown in real time by displaying the last successfully processed ID.

You may see a warning like:
"[timestamp] DEPRECATION WARNING: please use MorganGenerator"
This warning originates from the RDKit sascorer module and is not caused by this script.
It is safe to ignore; the script will produce correct SA_Score values.

For full details about how this script works, refer to the main script in this folder.
