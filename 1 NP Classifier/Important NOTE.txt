'1_Database classification counts and plots.ipynb' 

1)This code is designed to clasify natural products from its SMILES strings.
2)When a database is updated and new compounds are added to a database that already have their compounds classified with this code, it is recomended:
	2.1)Use this code to classify the new compounds in a separate file.
	2.2)Then integrate the new compounds into the database, including the calculated Pathway, SuperClass and Class.
	2.3)Use the code '2_Just counts and plots' to calculate the counts and construct the pie charts with the updated database.

'2_Just counts and plots'
1)This code doesn't classify compounds, instead, just obtain the counts and pie charts of a database which compounds were already classified with 
'1_Database classification counts and plots.ipynb'.
2)It is designed for the case when new compounds are added to a database which compounds were previously classified with '1_Database classification counts and plots.ipynb'.
	2.1)The first step is to use the code '1_Database classification counts and plots.ipynb' in a separate file that just contain the new compounds curated, to obtain 
	the classification of the new compounds.
	2.2)After merging the new compounds already classified with the whole database (including their NP classification), use this code to obtain the counts and pie charts 
	of the whole database.
3)This code was created because if it's intended to update the database with new compounds, when using the code '1_Database classification counts and plots.ipynb', 
to the database merged with the new compounds, the code '1_Database...' would obtain not just the classification of the new compounds but also the classification of the already 
classified compounds.
